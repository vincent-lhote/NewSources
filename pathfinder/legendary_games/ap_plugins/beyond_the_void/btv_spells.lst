Cosmic Communion	TYPE:Arcane		SCHOOL:Divination	DESCRIPTOR:Mythos	CASTTIME:10 minutes	COMPS:V		RANGE:personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:concentration	DESC:This spell casts your mind out across the cosmos, into contact with alien intelligences from far beyond. Except as noted above, this spell functions like contact other plane, but if you fail the Intelligence check to avoid decreasing your Intelligence and Charisma to 8, you also take Wisdom damage equal to the difference between your Intelligence check and the target DC. In addition, failing this check attracts the attention and interest of the cosmic entity you contacted, with a chance equal to 5% times the difference between your Intelligence check and the target DC that the entity sends one or more alien minions to investigate within 1d10 days. Treat this as a summon monster spell using the Summon Star-Spawn feat (see above), summoning one or more mythos creatures or creatures with the alien template. This functions as summon monster III if using the Elemental Plane line, increasing the level of the summon monster effect by one step for each step by which the caster tries to increase the power of his divination. These summoned creatures focus their attention on the caster of cosmic communion but will happily destroy any other creatures that get in their way or happen to be nearby when they appear. If they appear during a battle, they are equally likely to target the caster's enemies as his allies. Optional Rule: If using the alternate Madness and Sanity rules from Tomes of Arcane Knowledge, you gain an equivalent number of Madness points instead of Wisdom damage.

Deform Angularity	TYPE:Arcane	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation	DESCRIPTOR:Mythos	CASTTIME:1 standard action	CLASES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5|Summoner=4	COMPS:V	RANGE:personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]	DESC:Your body is transpatially distorted into otherworldly geometries too alien to contemplate. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to your Armor Class, and any effect targeting you has a 50% chance to bypass you and instead be redirected toward a random creature within 10 feet (or to simply fail, if no creature is within this range). Effects that you create are not affected, but even effects that do not require attack rolls or normally hit automatically can be affected. A creature using true strike ignores the effect of this spell.	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	SOURCESHORT:BtV	SOURCLONG:Beyond the Void
Embryonic Implantation	TYPE:Arcane	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Mythos	CLASSES:Alchemist,Summoner=5|Sorcerer,Wizard=6	CASTTIME:1 minute	COMPS:V, S, M (a bit of flesh from a creature with the mythos subtype)	RANGE:touch	TARGET:creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous and see text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:yes	DESC:Tapping into the genetic material of an alien creature, you impregnate a creature you touched with an aberrant abomination that grows slowly to maturity inside the target's body. If the target saves, the embryo fails to implant and the spell has no effect. If the save fails, you may stipulate the time span of the embryo's maturation, which may be 2d6 hours, 2d6 days, 2d6 months, or 2d6 years. During this time, the alien seed exists as a parasite bonded to the target's vitals. Conjuration (healing) effects treat the embryo as part of the target's body and do not harm the embryo. However, break enchantment can remove it with a successful caster level check. Poison that deals Constitution damage can also kill the embryo, acting like break enchantment but rolling 1d20 and adding the number of points of Constitution damage or drain dealt to the host in place of a caster level check. Make a single check when the embryo matures; any Constitution damage or drain that has been healed does not apply to this check. The embryo also dies if the host does, even if the host is later returned to life. The implanted embryo is difficult to detect, as most divinations treat it as part of the host. However, detect chaos, detect aberration, and locate creature can detect the presence of the embryo with a successful caster level check against a DC of 20 plus your caster level, as can a Heal check against the same DC. The maturing embryo saps at the vitality and sanity of the target. Whichever time increment you have selected (hours, days, months, or years), each time that increment passes the target takes 1 point of Wisdom drain. Once Wisdom drain occurs, the target becomes mentally unstable and takes a -2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects and must always attempt a saving throw to resist normally harmless healing effects. When the maturation period described above ends, the target becomes violently ill, becoming fatigued and sickened. A DC 30 Perception check (or DC 20 Heal check, if the host is closely examined) reveals something writhing and stretching within the host's body. Every round thereafter, the target takes 1 point of Constitution drain as the implanted embryo begins eating its way out of its host and must make a new Fortitude save against the spell's DC. Each time the save is failed, he gains one of the following conditions (determine randomly): 01-25 confused; 26-50 exhausted; 51-75 nauseated; 76-00 panicked. Whenever the target reaches 0 Constitution, or on the third failed save in any case, the target dies at the end of its turn and the embryonic creature bursts forth from its body. The type of embryonic creature that can be implanted depends on your caster level. Any CL: Embryonic aboleth, CL > 14: Embryonic intellect devourer or neh-thalggu, CL > 17: Embryonic shoggoth. Once mature, the embryonic creature is an independent being and has no allegiance to the caster. It devours the remains of its original host and seeks out further prey to help it grow into its full-sized adult form.	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	SOURCESHORT:BtV	SOURCELONG:Beyond the Void
Discharge Eyespore	TYPE:Arcane	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Mythos	CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Wizard,Summoner=4	CASTTIME:1 minute	COMPS:V, S, M (an eyeball from the caster)	RANGE:personal	TARGET:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until discharged	DESC:You pluck out one of your own eyes, while creating a levitating protoplasmic sac to encase it. The act of removing an eye deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the caster and leaves him dazzled until the eyespore is replaced in his eye socket; if the eyespore is destroyed, the dazzled condition becomes permanent, though remove blindness/deafness, regenerate, or heal removes the condition. If you are affected by the countless eyes spell when you cast discharge eyespore, you may choose to discharge the remaining duration of that spell in lieu of taking Constitution damage and becoming dazzled. The eyespore functions similarly to prying eyes but creates only a single floating oculus. However, the eyespore gains all-around vision and in addition to normal sight has blindsight in a radius equal to 10 feet per 5 caster levels. The protoplasmic sac encasing the eyespore is filled with unstable gas that allows it to float and propel itself, and if the eyespore is damaged it explodes in a 10-foot radius, dealing 6d6 points of damage (DC 16 Reflex half). In addition, creatures within this blast radius are exposed to blinding sickness.	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	SOURCESHORT:BtV	SOURCELONG:Beyond the Void
Fade from Existance	TYPE:Arcane	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation	DESCRIPTOR:Mythos	CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Wizard,Summoner=4	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	COMPS:V	Range:personal	TARGET:you	DURATION:1 round	DESC:You slip loose from the bounds of ordinary reality into the weird hyperspatial dimension of your cultic patrons. While in this extradimensional reality you can perceive the normal world around you and you can move through creatures or solid objects as if you were incorporeal, but creatures within normal reality can perceive you or affect you. In fact, when you fade from existence creatures within line of sight to you temporarily forget that you ever existed for 1 round (DC 20 Will negates). Creatures that have forgotten your existence cannot ready actions that depend on your actions. You can target yourself or objects you carry with spells or effects while you fade from existence but you cannot affect other creatures or objects. Time passes normally when you fade from existence, and you reappear within reality at the end of your next turn. This brief transit through alien unreality causes you to become confused for 1 round (DC 20 Will negates) upon reverting to normal reality. Optional Rule: You gain 1 Madness point rather than becoming confused at the conclusion of the spell (DC 20 Will negates).	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	SOURCESHORT:BtV	SOURCELONG:Beyond the Void
Shroud of Stars	TYPE:Arcane	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Glamer and Shadow	DESCRIPTOR:Mythos	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, F (a black silken and velvet mask studded with crushed black and star sapphires - 1000 gp)	RANGE:personal	TARGET:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]	DESC:You cloak yourself in a cosmic curtain, your silhouette filled with inky blackness and swirling celestial bodies. While your outline is unchanged, the details of your appearance cannot be seen while so glamered. Attacks against you have a 20% miss chance, though you do not gain actual concealment. You gain low-light vision and if outdoors at night you gain fast healing 2. The shroud of stars renders you immune to effects with the light or darkness descriptor, whether they target you or affect an area, as well as pattern spells, searing light, and prismatic spray. In addition, if a spell of these types includes you in its area of effect, as an immediate action you can make a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 plus the caster level of the effect. With a successful check, the entire effect is harmlessly absorbed by the shroud of stars. However, this reduces the remaining duration of the shroud of stars by a number of rounds equal to the level of the absorbed spell. You can attempt to absorb existing effects of these types as a standard action, but the DC is increased to 15 plus the creator's caster level. The shroud of stars also protects you from the harmful effects of prismatic wall and prismatic sphere, and a successful caster level check against a DC of 15 plus the caster level of the prismatic wall or prismatic sphere's creator enables you to pass through the prismatic sphere or prismatic wall as the caster can. This reduces the remaining duration of the shroud of stars by 10 rounds.	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	SOURCESHORT:BtV	SOURCELONG:Beyond the Void
