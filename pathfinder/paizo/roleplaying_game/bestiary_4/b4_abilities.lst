# Drake (Shadow)
Shadow Blend	KEY:Drake (Shadow) ~ Shadow Blend		TYPE:Race ~ Drake (Shadow).Supernatural.SpecialQuality.Defense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:In conditions of illumination other than bright light, a shadow drake disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (20%% miss chance). It can resume or suspend this ability as a free action.
Speed Surge		KEY:Drake (Shadow) ~ Speed Surge		TYPE:Race ~ Drake (Shadow).Extraordinary.SpecialAttack.Offense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Three times per day as a swift action, a shadow drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.
Stygian Breath	KEY:Drake (Shadow) ~ Stygian Breath		TYPE:Race ~ Drake (Shadow).Supernatural.SpecialAttack.Offense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a standard action, a shadow drake can exhale a ball of black liquid that explodes into a cloud of frigid black mist. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 12 half) to all creatures within a 5-foot-radius spread. The mist snuffs out light sources in the area effect, extinguishing nonmagical light sources and dispelling light spells of 1st level or lower. Once a shadow drake has used its stygian breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
