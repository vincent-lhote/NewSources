Weapon and Armor Proficiencies	KEY:Vigilante ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiencies		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Dual Identity				KEY:Vigilante ~ Dual Identity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a vigilante learns to hide his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of being a ruthless vigilante. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names, his true name used in polite company and his vigilante name used to strike fear in those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante has been captured and his identity revealed to the world at large. The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 5 minutes and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante's secrets. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); it often also involves make-up, hair, and other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items like hat of disguise do not reduce the time required to change identities. Many of the class features of the vigilante are usable only when the vigilante is in one of his two identities, as noted in the ability. A vigilante can possess two alignments, one for each of his identity. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity's alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that target alignment. For the purposes of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or other ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante's two alignments must be within one step of each other. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is neutral, lawful good, lawful neutral, or lawful evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both alignments to the new alignment. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in an identity known to the creature attempting to locate him. If he is in an identity unknown to the creature, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness as if the target was invalid or did not exist.
Seamless Guise				KEY:Vigilante ~ Seamless Guise					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.3	DESC:A vigilante knows how to behavein a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.
Vigilante Specialization		KEY:Vigilante ~ Vigilante Specialization			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.3	DESC:At 1st level, a vigilante must select a specialization that determines many of the abilities granted to him when he assumes his vigilante identity. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Each specialization grants a base ability at 1st level and a number of class skills. In addition, each specialization has a number of unique talents that can be selected with the talent class feature. The base ability and bonus class skills apply when the vigilante is in either of his identities, but all of the other abilities are available only when he is in his vigilante identity, unless stated otherwise. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's level + the vigilante's Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.

Startling Appearance			KEY:Vigilante ~ Startling Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante's presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as f latfooted for the rest of the vigilante's turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge) and the foe takes a -4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante's next turn.
Frightening Appearance			KEY:Vigilante ~ Frightening Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:At 11th level, whenever the vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante's presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, make an Intimidate skill check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies with 10 feet who witness the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of his attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds on a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's class level + his Charisma modifier). Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful) it is immune to that vigilante's frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Stunning Appearance			KEY:Vigilante ~ Stunning Appearance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante's presence (see startling appearance above), the foe must make a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's level + the vigilante's Charisma modifier or be stunned until the end of the vigilante's next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante's level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the save is successful), it is immune to that vigilante's stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Vengeance Strike				KEY:Vigilante ~ Vengeance Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:At 20th level, a vigilante can spend a standard action to study a target that is unaware of the vigilante (or does not see him as a threat). He can continue to spend standard actions in this way, up to a maximum of 5 standard actions, but all must be spent in consecutive rounds. After studying a target, the vigilante can, in the next round, declare that he is making a vengeance strike against the target. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante can grant himself a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, gain +3d6 points of precision damage, or treat his die roll as if it were 2 higher for the purpose of determining if the attack hit or if it threatens a critical hit (maximum 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way, but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. A vengeance strike must be declared within 1 round of studying a target and all rounds of study are expended when the vigilante declares a vengeance strike.

Case the Joint				KEY:Social Talent ~ Case The Joint				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The vigilante can use his social identity to learn important facts about a location before returning later in his vigilante identity. If he spends at least 1 hour in a location while in his social identity, he can attempt a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) check. If he succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check involving the location’s layout (such as a Stealth check to sneak into the location, a Disable Device check to disable an alarm, or a Sleight of Hand check to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the vigilante gains an additional reroll. If the vigilante fails to return to the location within 1 week, the situation changes too much and he cannot use the rerolls. A vigilante can’t case the same joint more than once a week.

While within his area of renown, he can always receive common meals or lodging (worth up to 1 gp per meal or night) for free, and can avoid paying taxes or bribes of 1 gp or less. If he wants a particular nonmagical item worth 1 gp or less, he can spend 1d10 minutes interacting with people in his area of renown to receive the item from a fan (if he ever sells such a gift from a fan, he loses this social talent permanently).

Double Time					KEY:Social Talent ~ Double Time					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The vigilante’s social identity is that of a skilled and respected artisan or professional, rather than a merchant or noble. In order to complete his day’s work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the Craft or Profession skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he’s chosen with social grace. A vigilante must have a social identity appropriate to the chosen skill to select this talent.
Everyman					KEY:Social Talent ~ Everyman					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:The vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise skill checks to appear as that individual and any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50% chance of finding the vigilante or the actual individual. Although this doesn't grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante's training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff skill checks to properly play the part of the specific individual.

DESC:If he has the renown social talent and gathers the information in his area of renown, he must instead spend only 1d4 × 10 minutes, and if he beats the DC to gather a piece of information by 20 or more, he knows that piece of information without spending any time at all; he has simply already heard that gossip.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown		 DESC:This ability doesn’t allow him to gather information that isn’t available in the locale he is canvassing, even if that locale is his area of renown.

He vigilante can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two smaller communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns).

Loyal Aid					KEY:Social Talent ~ Loyal Aid					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The vigilante gains the service of a number of loyal allies that can help him gather information, cover for his two identities, or perform minor tasks. Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this ability gains a bonus on Diplomacy checks made to gather information equal to 1/2 his vigilante level. In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of Diplomacy checks made to gather information about the vigilante and Survival checks made to track him by an amount equal to his level. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week. Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger.

Many Guises					KEY:Social Talent ~ Many Guises					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he has a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise skill checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a hat of disguise), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion).

Mockingbird 				KEY:Social Talent ~ Mockingbird					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance.

Quick Change				KEY:Social Talent ~ Quick Change				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The vigilante learns to shift between his identities with ease. Instead of needing 5 minutes to change his identity, he can now do so as a fullround action. If he uses this ability and he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must make a Disguise skill check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that they are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 minute adjusting and perfecting his appearance to negate the need for this check.		PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Vigilante"),7
Renown						KEY:Social Talent ~ Renown						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities, regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends and air of menace while facing down his enemies. While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village if using settlement statistics). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs treat their starting attitude toward him as one category better, as long as their initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see the Diplomacy skills on pages 93-94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, whenever he is in his vigilante identity, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate skill checks. This bonus applies only while he is within a number of miles equal to his vigilante level from the community in which he has gained renown. A vigilante can hold renown in only a limited number of communities (one or possibly two at higher levels). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These bonuses and abilities are subject to GM approval. The GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard the tales or, in rare cases, might respond negatively if the NPC targeted by the check is a foe of the vigilante.

If he doesn’t have the renown talent, he can still select this talent and place the safe house in a single location to which he has access, but he can never move the safe house from its initial location until he gains the renown talent. This safe house must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is a number of feet per side equal to 10 feet per vigilante level. The safe house can be arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house can’t be located by any effect that is less powerful than a discern location spell.

At 5th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, he can select another skill (with the same restrictions) to gain this bonus.
Subjective Truth 			KEY:Social Talent ~ Subjective Truth			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The vigilante’s disparate identities allow him to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what he says is true from the point of view of his current identity, it detects as true to effects such as discern lies, and he can say it in effects such as zone of truth that force him to speak the truth.

For each such ability that the creature possesses, if the vigilante is not bypassing the sense in another way—such as the negate aroma spell for scent or flying for tremorsense—the creature gains a stacking +20 circumstance bonus on all Perception check to notice the vigilante, rather than automatically noticing the vigilante.

Returning Weapon 		KEY:Vigilante Talent ~ Returning Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC: The vigilante has a signature type of thrown weapon that returns to him.

If he chose a non-ammunition thrown weapon instead, he can apply the magical properties of the first weapon he throws in a round to any nonmagical thrown weapons of that type he throws that round. This allows him to make a full attack with the benefits of his magical thrown weapon, even though it only returns next round.

###Block: Archetypes
METAMORPH (ARCHETYPE)
Metamorphs eschew traditional alchemy, focusing on
internal chemistry and the transfiguration of living forms.
Class Skills: A metamorph adds Disguise to her list of
class skills.
This alters the alchemist’s class skills.
Shapechanger (Su): At 1st level, a metamorph gains
the ability to transform herself into another form. This
ability functions like alter self, except as noted here. The
effect lasts for 1 hour per metamorph’s alchemist level, or
until she changes back. Changing form (to another form
or back) is a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of
opportunity. The metamorph is fatigued for 1 round each
time she changes shape.
A metamorph can use this ability once per day at 1st
level, and an additional time per day at 4th level, and every
2 alchemist levels thereafter, for a total of nine times at
18th level. At 20th level, a metamorph can use shapechanger
as a free action once per round, either before or after all her
other actions, with no daily limit.
This ability can also function as monstrous physique IUM at
5th level, as monstrous physique IIUM at 9th level, as monstrous
physique IIIUM at 11th level, as monstrous physique IVUM or giant
form I at 13th level, and as giant form II at 15th level.
This ability replaces alchemy (which also includes bombs,
extracts, and mutagen) and Throw Anything.
Mutagen (Ex): At 1st level, a metamorph gains mutagen
as a normal alchemist. She can take mutagen and
cognatogen discoveries despite not possessing the alchemy
class feature that normally grants mutagen.
Adaptive Physiology (Ex): At 3rd level, a metamorph gains
a 25% chance to negate critical hits and precision damage,
similar to the preserve organs discovery. This chance
increases to 50% at 6th level, and to 75% at 18th level.
This ability replaces swift alchemy, swift poisoning, and
instant alchemy.
