AVOIDANCE WARD
	SCHOOL:enchantment (compulsion)
	CLASSES:4
	CASTTIME:40 minutes
	COMPS:V, M (a piece of rowan wood charcoal), F (a small silver mirror worth 50 gp)
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one dungeon door
	DURATION:8 hours
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)
	SPELLRES: yes (harmless, object)
	DESC:Skill Checks Knowledge (dungeoneering) DC 30, 3 successes; Spellcraft DC 30, 1 success, Backlash The caster takes 4d6 points of damage. Failure The target door swings open and cannot be closed by the caster by any means short of a limited wish for 24 hours. EFFECT The caster begins by placing a mirror on one side of the door and writing occult symbols on the other side of the door that conform to one type or subtype of creature on the ranger's favored enemy list (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 64). Upon completion of the ritual, creatures of the chosen type or subtype cannot open, touch, or even magically manipulate the door by any means (with no save or spell resistance applicable). A dungeon door can have only one avoidance ward at a time.
BREACH THE VEIL OF DREAMS
	SCHOOL:conjuration (creation)
	CLASSES:6
	CASTTIME:60 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (incenses burned in a bowl filled with
grave earth, a bottle of wormwood wine for each caster), F
(an ornate silver and mithral key worth 5,000 gp), SC (up to
the Intelligence modifier of the primary caster)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 32, 3 successes;
Knowledge (planes) DC 32, 3 successes
	RANGE:touch
	DURATION:instantaneous; see text
	SAVEINFO:none
	SPELLRES: no
Backlash The primary caster takes 2d6 points of damage and
becomes exhausted.
Failure An animate dream (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 29)
appears at the site of the ritual and attacks the casters. At the
GM's discretion, the animate dream may have the advanced
template, be accompanied by fellow animate dreams, or both.
EFFECT
This ritual must be cast at night on the Material Plane. The casters drink the wormwood wine and begin chanting the incantation as the incense burns. The casters mix the ashes with the grave earth and use the mixture to draw a threshold with a keyhole. They then insert the key into this door as the incantation is completed. Success indicates the casters pass through the portal and enter a random location on the Dimension of Dreams. If the casters wish to return to the Material Plane from the Dimension of Dreams, each must succeed at a DC 35 concentration check to do so. This is a full-round action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The DC of this check is reduced by 1 for every 2d6 points of damage the traveler willingly takes from psychic and physical trauma as part of the full-round action (this damage can't be reduced in any way). If successful, the caster is transported back to the site of the ritual's casting of the Material Plane. The casters can try again if they fail their concentration checks. A caster can use her character level + her Charisma modifier as her bonus on the concentration check if she isn't a spellcaster or if that value is higher than her usual concentration bonus.

CALL BEYOND THE VEIL
	SCHOOL:conjuration (calling)
	CLASSES:6
	CASTTIME:60 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, F (either an object once possessed by the
spirit or entity called, or the name of the spirit or entity
called), SC (up to 8)
Skill Checks Diplomacy DC 31, 2 successes; Knowledge (religion)
DC 33, 3 successes; Knowledge (planes) DC 33, 1 success
	RANGE:primary caster
	TARGETAREA:call on the spirit of a single deceased creature or a
psychic entity
	DURATION:concentration of the primary caster
	SAVEINFO:Will negates
	SPELLRES: no
Backlash All casters become exhausted and gain 1 temporary
negative level (DC = 16 + primary caster's Charisma bonus to
remove after the first day).
Failure All casters gain 1 permanent negative level and are
exhausted until that negative level is removed.
EFFECT
The primary caster attempts to compel the spirit of a specific individual or a psychic entity to manifest from its final rest or extraplanar location. Unwilling spirits or entities can resist the summons by succeeding at a Will save. If a spirit or entity succeeds at the saving throw, it doesn't manifest, but the ritual is still considered a success. Spirits or entities that fail or forgo this save are summoned into the primary caster's body, where they speak by way of the caster's voice, which takes on an otherworldly timbre. Though the spirit or entity speaks through the primary caster, it has no further control of that caster's mind or body, and can't use any spells, spell-like abilities, or even purely mental supernatural abilities it may have. It must leave the primary caster when that caster ends his concentration. While the spirit is speaking through the primary caster, the secondary casters can ask it questions at a maximum rate of 1 question per round (regardless of the number of secondary casters). The spirit or entity speaks in a language it knows or knew while it was alive, and can refuse to answer questions or attempt to deceive its questioners and the primary caster using Bluff. It is not otherwise beholden to the ritual casters.

ENSNARING CIRCLE
	SCHOOL:abjuration [variable; see text]
	CLASSES:4
	CASTTIME:40 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (powdered silver), F (a stylus made of
mithral and diamond worth 5,000 gp), SC (up to 8)
Skill Checks Knowledge (planes) DC 30, 2 successes; Knowledge
(religion) DC 30, 1 success; Linguistics DC 30, 1 success
	RANGE:10 ft.
	TARGETAREA:a 20-foot-radius magic circle
	DURATION:1 day/character level of the primary caster
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES: no, see text
Backlash The primary caster takes 2d6 points of damage.
Failure The casters believe their work was successful, though
when they attempt to use the circle, nothing occurs.
EFFECT
This ritual requires the casters to create a large magic circle outlined with the silver powder and shaped with the focus stylus. The circle must be painstakingly molded to attune it to the alignment targeted (chaos, evil, good, or law), which is chosen during the time of creation. The ritual gains the descriptor of the alignment selected. Once the circle is complete, it becomes invisible to all but the casters of the ritual or to creatures with see invisibility, true seeing, or some other method of seeing invisible objects. Once the circle is complete, it can be used to trap an outsider whose subtype matches the chosen alignment, as if it were an inward-focused magic circle spell of the appropriate type (thus, an ensnaring circle attuned to evil acts like an inward-focused magic circle against evil). For an outsider to be trapped in this manner, the entire space of the outsider must be within the circle, at which point the primary caster can activate the circle as an immediate action. The primary caster must be within 100 feet of the circle and be able to see it and the outsider he wishes to trap in order to activate the circle. It is possible to trap multiple outsiders of the appropriate subtype in the circle if more than one are in the circle when it is activated. However, if any such outsider is not completely within the circle, it is not caught within the circle's confines and is free to disrupt the circle as described in the magic circle against evil spell description. As with a magic circle, the trapped outsider cannot cross the circle's boundaries or reach over or beyond the boundaries, nor can it disrupt the circle either directly or indirectly, though it can make ranged attacks beyond the circle's boundaries. If the outsider has spell resistance, it can test the trap once per day. If the primary caster fails to overcome the outsider's spell resistance, the circle is disrupted and the outsider is freed from the circle's restraints. An outsider capable of any form of dimensional travel can simply leave the circle using such an ability. Unlike with a magic circle, you cannot create a special diagram when creating the circle to make the ensnaring circle more secure.
ETHEREAL RIP
	SCHOOL:evocation
	CLASSES:5
	CASTTIME:50 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (a dollop of ectoplasm and paste extracted
from ground lotus root worth 500 gp), F (an obsidian dagger
with at least a +2 enhancement bonus and the ghost touch
special weapon ability, worth at least 18,301 gp)
Skill Checks Knowledge (planes) DC 29, 3 successes;
Knowledge (geography) DC 29, 2 successes
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:a rip between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane
	DURATION:1 hour/primary caster's character level and
instantaneous; see text
	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates
	SPELLRES: no
Backlash The caster takes 4d6 points of damage.
Failure The caster gains the incorporeal subtype and is confused
for 24 hours.
EFFECT
Upon this ritual's completion, the focus dagger is imbued with the power to cut a momentary rift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, though only if the caster adheres to the restrictions of the ritual. At the ritual's start, the caster must find the perfect spot for such an incision: a place where the features of the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane are closely aligned (the exact spot is determined by the GM). Then, after mumbling an incantation that weakens the borders of those two planes at that location, the caster must evenly coat the entire focus blade with a mixture of the material components. When that is compete, the ritual is successful and the backlash occurs, but the ritual's true effect can be delayed. As long as the caster does not move from her space, and does not stop holding the focus dagger, she can use the dagger to cut into the weakened border between the two planes as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but she must do so within 1 hour per character level after successfully completing the ritual and taking the backlash. Doing so has an immediate and dramatic effect-the rip attempts to suck all creatures and unattended objects within 30 feet of the caster's space that weigh less than 200 pounds into either the Ethereal Plane (if the rip is made on the Material Plane) or the Material Plane (if the rip is made on the Ethereal Plane). With a successful Reflex save, a creature avoids the rip's pull. Creatures and objects pulled into the rift land in a corresponding space on the other plane. The ritual caster can choose whether she wants to be sucked through the rift or stay on the plane where she cast the ritual.

HAUNTED COMMUNION
	SCHOOL:necromancy
	CLASSES:7
	CASTTIME:70 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (special paints and a small, salted pastry),
F (silver bell worth 500 gp), SC (up to 18)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 31, 3 successes; Knowledge
(religion) DC 31, 3 successes, Linguistics DC 31, 1 success
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one haunt within 60 feet
	DURATION:1 hour and 10 rounds (D); see text
	SAVEINFO:Will negates
	SPELLRES: yes
Backlash The primary caster is exhausted.
Failure The casters take 1 permanent negative level and a
-4 penalty on all skill and ability checks for as long as the
negative level persists.
EFFECT
This ritual must be performed within 60 feet of a haunt. The primary caster rings the silver bell using an object associated with the haunt's origin or source of power. Once this is done, the primary caster draws an intricate circle adorned with occult symbols around a plate bearing the small, salted pastry. If the incantation is successful, the haunt's spirit enters into the pastry (making the haunt inert for the duration of the ritual) and one of the casters must eat the pastry before the next hour or the ritual ends. Failure to do so allows the haunt to go free and increases any DCs of the haunt's effects by 4 and grants a +4 bonus on attack rolls made by the haunt for 24 hours. Once a caster eats the pastry, the spirit of the haunt speaks through the individual who ate the pastry, and is required to truthfully answer 10 questions (1 question per round) before departing, though since the haunt is an emotional echo, the answers may be brief, cryptic, or repetitive, as with speak with dead. Once the 10 questions are answered or the spell is dismissed, the haunt can manifest as normal.
OPENING THE THIRD EYE
	SCHOOL:transmutation
	CLASSES:5
	CASTTIME:50 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (incense), SC (up to 12)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 34, 3 successes; Knowledge
(planes) DC 34, 1 success; Perception DC 34, 1 success
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:primary and secondary casters
	DURATION:1 day (D)
	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES: yes (harmless)
Backlash All casters take 2d6 points of damage.
Failure All casters gain a temporary negative level (DC = 16 +
primary caster's Charisma bonus to remove after the first day),
and the primary caster is afflicted with a more potent version
of the mindfire disease (DC 17; 2 saves; 1d4 Int; 1/day).
EFFECT
Through a ceremony of meditation and recitation, the casters of this ritual become psychically attuned. Casters who don't have levels in an occult class gain the following benefits.  *  Each caster can choose one knack from the psychic class's spell list and an additional knack for every 5 character levels that caster possesses (to a maximum of 5 knacks at 20th level). The casters can cast these knacks at will.  *  If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can use that skill's occult unlock. Casters who do have levels in an occult base class gain the following benefits.  *  If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she gains a +4 insight bonus on checks with that skill when using its occult skill unlock.  *  If a caster is untrained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can still use that skill's occult unlock. Each of the ritual's casters can choose to dismiss this ritual's effects for themselves individually.
PSYCHIC SHIELDING
	SCHOOL:abjuration
	CLASSES:6
	CASTTIME:60 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (diamond dust worth 500 gp), F (mithral
mirrors worth a total of 10,000 gp and a lit lantern)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 33, 3 successes; Spellcraft
DC 33, 3 successes
	RANGE:touch
	TARGETAREA:one creature
	DURATION:1 day/character level of the caster
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES: yes (harmless)
Backlash The caster takes 2d6 points of damage and is exhausted.
Failure The caster takes 1 permanent negative level.
EFFECT
The caster must begin this incantation at dusk or dawn, in a windowless room with the intended target (if it is not the caster), surrounded by mithral mirrors pointed inward. As the ritual concludes, the caster blows out a lantern using the diamond dust, leaving her and the target in the darkened room. While in the darkness, the caster must touch the ritual's target before exiting the room. Then, for a number of days equal to the caster's character level, the target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against psychic spells and abilities, but can't use any psychic magic abilities, can't cast psychic spells or use psychic magic, and can't be engaged or engage in a psychic duel.
RITUAL EXORCISM
	SCHOOL:abjuration
	CLASSES:4
	CASTTIME:40 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (vial of holy water), F (silver holy symbol),
SC (up to 12)
Skill Checks Knowledge (religion) DC 28, 2 successes; Spellcraft
DC 28, 2 successes
	RANGE:close (25 ft. + 5 ft./character level of the primary caster)
	TARGETAREA:one helpless possessed creature or a restrained
possessed object
	DURATION:instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:Will negates
	SPELLRES: yes
Backlash All casters become exhausted.
Failure All casters gain 1 temporary negative level
(DC = 16 + primary caster's Charisma bonus to remove after the
first day), and the primary caster takes 4d6 points of damage.
EFFECT
You force the life force of a possessing creature to leave its host. Upon the completion of this ritual, the possessing creature attempts a Will saving throw. If it fails the save, the possessor is expelled, as if the duration of the spell or effect it used to possess the target had expired. If the possessing creature succeeds at the save, it continues to stay within the host creature or object, though the ritual can be attempted anew as long as the possessed creature is helpless or the object restrained.

SEEK ASTRAL INSIGHTS
	SCHOOL:divination
	CLASSES:6
	CASTTIME:60 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (a number of candles made of pure
beeswax equal to the number of wandering stars in
conjunction when the ritual is attempted), F (a mithral chain
worth 5,000 gp), SC (up to 8)
Skill Checks Knowledge (arcana) DC 31, 3 successes;
Knowledge (planes) DC 31, 3 successes
	RANGE:primary caster
	DURATION:1 hour/character level of the primary caster
Backlash The primary caster is rendered speechless for 1 week
(if the ritual fails, this duration begins after the end of the
feeblemind effect).
Failure The primary caster's Intelligence and Charisma scores
drop to 1 and she gains the other effects of a feeblemind
spell for 24 hours.
EFFECT
This ritual can be cast only at midnight on a night when no fewer than three wandering stars (planets) are in conjunction and within view of the casters. The ritual must be performed at the top of a hill, mountain, or other natural vantage point. The primary caster is first wrapped in the focus chains, and the candles are lit in the pattern of the stars in conjunction. The primary caster must sit in complete silence, concentrating on the light of the candles, while the secondary casters circle, chanting the occult incantation. If the ritual is successfully completed, the primary caster's mind is allowed to wander the Astral Plane unhindered, and she can ask one question each hour her mind wanders. The spirits of the Astral Plane answer the caster truthfully, though there is usually only a 60% chance that they will have the answer the primary caster seeks (the chance may be higher or lower at the GM's discretion, depending on the nature of the information sought). If they don't have the answer, the spirits admit that they lack the knowledge the caster seeks rather than trying to deceive her.

VEIL STRUCTURE
	SCHOOL:illusion (glamer)
	CLASSES:8
	CASTTIME:80 minutes
	COMPS:V, S, M (a half-gallon of water from a fresh spring
and a potion of invisibility), F (a pair of mithral pitchers and
two golden aspergillums, worth 25,000 gp total), SC (at least
4 and up to 12)
Skill Checks Knowledge (nature or local; see below) DC 32,
4 successes; Spellcraft DC 32, 2 successes; Sleight of Hand
DC 32, 2 successes
	RANGE:close (25 ft. + 5 ft./character level of the primary caster)
	TARGETAREA:one 20-ft. cube/character level of primary caster
	DURATION:permanent (D)
	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)
	SPELLRES: no
Backlash The primary caster takes 1 permanent negative level.
Failure All casters cannot be targeted by any beneficial glamer
effects (such as invisibility) for 1 year (this is a curse effect,
and can be removed with remove curse and similar effects).
EFFECT
The primary caster starts this ritual by placing the fresh spring water in one of the mithral pitchers and the potion of invisibility within the other. The caster then mixes the components of the two pitchers by pouring the water into the pitcher that holds the potion and then transferring the mixed contents back into the pitcher that initially held the water. She then repeats this transference between pitchers six more times, before handing one of the pitchers to one of the secondary casters. In complete silence, the primary caster and the chosen secondary caster use the aspergillums to splash the mixture on a building or structure they wish to veil, which must be no larger than the ritual's area. If the building or structure is in a natural environment, the casters must attempt Knowledge (nature) checks for the ritual. If the building or structure is in an urban environment, they must attempt Knowledge (local) checks. Upon the successful completion of the ritual, the building is veiled, and it appears as if the area were devoid of anything but its natural or urban setting. All of the ritual casters are still able to see the faintest outline of the building and interact with it normally. The primary caster also gains the ability to grant up to 10 creatures per day that she touches the ability to see the faintest outline of the building for a 24-hour period.
