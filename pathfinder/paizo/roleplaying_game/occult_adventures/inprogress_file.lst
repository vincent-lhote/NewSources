Promethean Disciple					KEY:Discovery ~ Promethean Disciple				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Alchemist Discovery.SpecialQuality			DESC:An alchemist with this discovery learns how to craft constructs by way of alchemical research rather than arcane magic. The alchemist gains Craft Construct as a bonus feat without needing to meet its requirements. The alchemist substitutes his number of ranks in Craft (alchemy) for his total caster level and must use Craft (alchemy) to create the construct. The DC to create the construct still increases for any necessary spells that the alchemist does not have access to (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 549). However, the alchemist can use extracts in place of spells as spell prerequisites. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.

Ectoplasmic Blanche					KEY:Ectochymist ~ Ectoplasmic Blanche					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ectochymist Class Feature.Alchemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:An ectochymist can alchemically treat a melee weapon so that it deals full damage to incorporeal creatures. The process requires a full-round action and lasts until the next time that weapon is used to make an attack. An ectochymist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier.

SOURCEPAGE:p.112
Ghost Trap							KEY:Ectochymist ~ Ghost Trap							CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ectochymist Class Feature.Alchemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, an ectochymist can throw a trap to capture an incorporeal creature of up to 1 Hit Die per alchemist level he possesses. As a standard action, the ectochymist can expend a use of ectoplasmic blanche to coat the inside of a container with his blanche and throw it at an incorporeal creature as a ranged touch attack. If he hits, the creature receives a Will save to escape the trap (DC = 10 + 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier). If the creature fails its save, it is sealed within the vessel until someone breaks or opens that vessel. The ghost trap automatically survives being thrown at the incorporeal creature, but otherwise is only as durable as the vessel (normally hardness 5, 1 hp for a glass bottle).This ability replaces the 8th-level alchemist discovery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.112
Ectochymical Analysis					KEY:Ectochymist ~ Ectochymical Analysis					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ectochymist Class Feature.Alchemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 10th level, an ectochymist can use alchemical processes to uncover esoteric knowledge from a haunted area that would normally require divinations to ascertain.

Treat this effect as speak with hauntAPG with a saving throw DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the ectochymist's class level + the ectochymist's Charisma modifier and a caster level equal to the ectochymist's class level. Because the ectochymist is performing an analysis to answer his questions and not speaking with the haunt directly, he uses Craft (alchemy) rather than Sense Motive to oppose any Bluff checks the spirit might attempt in order to mislead him. This ability replaces poison immunity.

Homunculus Companion					KEY:Promethean Alchemist ~ Homunculus Companion					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Promethean Alchemist Class Feature.Alchemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a promethean alchemist gains the service of a homunculus companion. The means for creating this special homunculus are more exotic than normal and require investiture of the promethean alchemist's own life essence into the homunculus. This construct generally resembles a small humanoid or child when first created; the specific appearance is up to its creator, though a homunculus is always humanoid in shape and obviously unnatural on close inspection. While every homunculus companion is absolutely devoted to its master, some homunculi's loyalty borders on the unsettling; such companions jealously protect their masters from threats or construct strange shrines in their masters' honor. A homunculus companion can be of any alignment, even one that is different from its master's. A destroyed homunculus companion can be restored to life by performing a ritual with its corpse that requires 1 pint of its creator's blood per Hit Die of the homunculus and rare materials worth 100 gp per Hit Die of the homunculus. Performing this ritual takes 1 hour (though it may take some time to gather enough blood at higher levels, so many promethean alchemists keep chilled blood samples in storage just in case). A promethean alchemist can't take the mutagen or cognatogen discoveries. This ability replaces bombs and mutagen.

At 8th level, the flesheater can instead take on one of the creature's abilities listed under beast shape II.

# Ghost Rider
Ghost Mount							KEY:Ghost Rider ~ Ghost Mount				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Rider Class Feature.Cavalier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a ghost rider gains the ability to manifest a special mount of conjured ectoplasm rather than one of flesh and bone. This spectral companion functions like a spiritualist's phantom companion, using the ghost rider's cavalier level as her effective spiritualist level. The phantom takes the form of a ghostly creature analogous to one of a cavalier's normal mount options for her size and class level, such as a Large horse for a Medium ghost rider or a wolf for a Small ghost rider. A ghost rider must choose a mount that is capable of bearing her weight, that has four or more legs, and that lacks a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments). The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. The ghost rider can manifest her ghost mount only in ectoplasmic form, and she gains the spiritualist's etheric tether class feature, applied to her ghost mount. The mount shares the cavalier's alignment. Though the mount cannot speak, it understands its master's verbal commands and gains the phantom's link ability. The ghost mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and can have ranks in any of the following skills: Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Creatures within range that meet the ghost rider's gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ghost rider's class level + the ghost rider's Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures that successfully save against that ghost rider's frightful gaze are immune to it for 24 hours. At 9th level, this ability can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects, though it still counts as a fear effect. The ghost rider can use this ability a number of times each day equal to her Charisma modifier.

Spells							KEY:Relic Hunter ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Relic Hunter Class Feature.Inquisitor Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:A relic hunter casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list, but her chosen relic schools (see Relics below) limit her to schools she knows, similar in function to an occultist's implements. Any spell or orison gained by the relic hunter has a relic component (see Relics below), and is not considered to be on the relic hunter's spell list until she selects its school though the relics alternate class feature. Once she chooses a school, all spells and orisons of that school are considered to be on the relic hunter's class spell list, allowing her to use spell trigger and spell completion magic items of those spells. A relic hunter's spells per day, daily spell allotment, Difficulty Class, and minimum Wisdom score requirements remain unchanged from the inquisitor's normal spellcasting class feature. This ability alters the inquisitor's spellcasting.

Relics							KEY:Relic Hunter ~ Relics					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Relic Hunter Class Feature.Inquisitor Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a relic hunter gains the occultist's implements class feature (see page 47) and learns to use two occultist implement schools as relic schools. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the relic hunter learns to use one additional relic school drawn from the same source, gaining access to that school's resonant power and base focus power and opening up that school's focus powers for her to select. Like an occultist, a relic hunter can select the same school twice, but it is far less useful for her to do so. Relics do not need to be magic items, and nonmagical relics do not take up a magic item slot. Relics that are not magic items are often of some religious significance to the relic hunter or her church, such as the battered shield of a saint, a bishop's robe, or the finger bone of a church martyr. This ability replaces judgment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.119
Deific Focus						KEY:Relic Hunter ~ Deific Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Relic Hunter Class Feature.Inquisitor Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a relic hunter learns to invest divine power into her chosen relics. This acts like the occultist's focus powers and mental focus class features (see pages 47 and 48, respectively), with the following adjustments. Each day, a relic hunter has a number of points of deific focus equal to her inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier, and she must spend 1 hour in prayer with her relics to invest them with divine power. These points refresh at the start of each day. At 1st level, the relic hunter learns the two base focus powers from her chosen relic schools and can select one more focus power from the list of those made available by her chosen schools. Whenever she gains a new relic school, she gains the base focus power of that school. In addition, at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, she learns a new focus power selected from all of the powers granted by all of the relic schools she knows. She can use these focus powers only by expending points of deif ic focus. Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throws against a focus power is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's class level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modif ier. She cannot select a focus power more than once. She uses her inquisitor level in place of an occultist level to qualify for focus powers. This ability replaces domain, bane, greater bane, second judgment, and third judgment.

Only spells from the psychic class spell list of 6th level or lower and psychic detective spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective's spell list. If a spell appears on both the psychic detective and psychic class spell lists, the psychic detective uses the spell level from the psychic detective spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a psychic detective's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the psychic detective's Intelligence modifier. Like other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her investigator level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Core Rulebook). At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic detective can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the psychic detective can cast. A psychic detective need not prepare her spells in advance.

Harmony							KEY:Karmic Monk ~ Harmony						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Karmic Monk Class Feature.Monk Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 9th level, as an immediate action, a karmic monk can shift his alignment by one step for the purpose of all effects dependent on alignment until the beginning of his next turn. This does not actually alter the karmic monk's alignment. This ability replaces improved evasion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.122
Karmic Disruption						KEY:Karmic Monk ~ Karmic Disruption					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Karmic Monk Class Feature.Monk Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 16th level, a karmic monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to add 1d6 points of damage to his unarmed strikes against creatures of either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment for 1 round. This stacks with other abilities that deal damage based on alignment. He cannot alter his alignment choice until the next time he uses this ability. Creatures that are of the appropriate alignment and are struck by this attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the karmic monk's class level + the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier) or lose any damage reduction based on alignment for a number of rounds equal to the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to having its damage reduction disrupted by that karmic monk for 24 hours. This attack disrupts only alignment components of damage reduction, not any other components; for example, DR/cold iron and good becomes DR/cold iron. This ability replaces slow fall 80 feet, and alters slow fall at 19th level to become slow fall 80 feet.

Harmonic Self						KEY:Karmic Monk ~ Harmonic Self					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Karmic Monk Class Feature.Monk Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 20th level, a karmic monk is truly in tune with the harmonic balance of the universe. He gains the abilities of perfect self, except that instead of DR 10/chaotic, he gains DR 10 that is overcome only by attacks that do not count as chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. This ability alters perfect self.

# Ghost Hunter
Ghostly Smite						KEY:Ghost Hunter ~ Ghostly Smite						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Hunter Class Feature.Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A ghost hunter's smite evil ability does not automatically bypass DR (other than DR/good). However, she treats her weapon as a ghost touch weapon against the target of her smite. She does not deal extra damage on the first attack against evil outsiders and evil dragons, but she deals 3 points of damage per paladin level she possesses to undead creatures on the first attack (instead of 2 points). This ability alters smite evil.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Exorcise Possession					KEY:Ghost Hunter ~ Exorcise Possession					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Hunter Class Feature.Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 6th level, a ghost hunter can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature. She must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and expend a use of her lay on hands ability. The target can immediately attempt a Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the effect immediately ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw. This ability replaces the 6th-level mercy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Speak to the Restless					KEY:Ghost Hunter ~ Speak to the Restless					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Hunter Class Feature.Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 9th level, a ghost hunter can commune with the spirits of the restless dead once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, she can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the ghost hunter must have the creature's head in her possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt's location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as speak with hauntACG or as speak with dead (but affecting only undead rather than only corpses), using the ghost hunter's class level as the caster level. This ability replaces the 9th-level mercy.
