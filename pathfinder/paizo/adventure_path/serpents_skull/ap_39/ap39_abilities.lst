Final Revelation		KEY:Juju Mystery ~ Final Revelation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:JujuRevelation.OracleRevelation.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:You gain mastery over spirits and the fundamentals of life. When you cast trap the soul, you can choose to imprison just the target's soul in the gem as per the spell magic jar, leaving its body soulless and, by all appearances, dead. Once the gem is occupied by a soul, you may, as a standard action, swap your essence with that in the gem, giving the trapped soul control over your body while harboring your own spirit within the gem. While within the gem, you have no control over your body or the soul occupying it, but may attempt to possess other creatures-including your now possessed body-as per the spell magic jar. Alternatively, you may swap souls between other creatures. By trapping a soul within a gem you can then use that gem to make a single touch attack against another creature. If you succeed, the target must succeed at a Will save or have its soul trapped within the gem, while the soul in the gem transfers into the target's body. The soul within the gem does not gain the power to possess other creatures (as per magic jar) and the gem cannot be used to transfer souls again unless a second trap the soul spell is cast upon it.
