Casting					KEY:Soul Weaver ~ Casting									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:A soul weaver may combine spheres and talents to create magical effects. A soul weaver is considered a High-Caster and uses Charisma as her casting ability modifier. (Note: All casters gain 2 bonus talents and may select a casting tradition the first time they gain the casting class feature.)
Spell Pool					KEY:Soul Weaver ~ Spell Pool									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:A soul weaver gains a small reservoir of energy she can call on to create truly wondrous effects, called a spell pool. This pool contains a number of spell points equal to her level + her Charisma modifier (minimum: 1). This pool replenishes once per day after roughly 8 hours of rest.
Magic Talents				KEY:Soul Weaver ~ Magic Talents								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:A soul weaver gains a magic talent every level, according to Table: Soul Weaver.

Channel Energy				KEY:Soul Weaver ~ Channel Energy								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:A soul weaver may summon waves of spiritual energy that affect nearby creatures. This is identical to the cleric class feature, and allows the soul weaver to qualify for all channeling feats. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier (minimum: 1). She must choose at 1st level whether to channel positive or negative energy, after which this decision may not be changed. A soul weaver’s choice to channel positive or negative energy is not connected to their alignment, and any soul weaver may channel either energy.

Bound Nexus					KEY:Soul Weaver ~ Bound Nexus									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:A soul weaver’s greatest strength is the souls she collects. A soul weaver may possess a number of souls at once equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier (minimum: 1). These souls may be turned visible or invisible as a free action (if visible, they appear as wisps of energy that glow dimly). Summoning spirits takes 1 minute, and a soul weaver cannot summon more spirits in a day than 1 + her Charisma modifier (minimum: 1). Once summoned, the spirits remain until used, and either orbit the soul weaver (moving as she does at the same speed), or may be directed to move independently as a move action. A soul weaver may move as many souls as she wishes with each move action, and souls have a fly speed of 40 ft and always succeed at fly checks. These souls are only projected into the Material plane and as such are immune to damage of any kind. A soul must remain within Medium range of the soul weaver, or disappear back to the nether. A soul weaver gains a number of abilities, each of which uses up a soul’s energy. When using a bound nexus ability, the expended soul returns to the nether until it is resummoned at a future date. Nexus powers require a standard action, and if a saving throw is required the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 soul weaver level + Charisma modifier. To use an ability, the target must be adjacent to the soul weaver (if the spirit is orbiting her), or else the soul weaver must first direct the soul to move into the target’s square.

Blessing/Blight				KEY:Soul Weaver ~ Blessing/Blight								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:All ensouled creatures are under a soul weaver’s power, and a soul weaver can cause incredible effects to befall both allies and enemies. At 2nd level, a soul weaver who chose to channel positive energy may grant blessings to targets, while a soul weaver who chose to channel negative energy may give blights. All blessings and blights may only be granted to living targets with souls. A target may only be under one blessing or blight at a time. Applying a blessing to a target with blight or vice-versa dispels both effects, leaving neither.

The soul weaver gains immunity to nonlethal damage, ability drain, and energy drain. Unintelligent undead ignore the soul weaver, treating her as another undead creature unless provoked. If the soul weaver should die, she may choose to rise 2d4 days later as a ghost.

#Block: Bound Nexus
Aid the Dead				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Aid the Dead								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:The soul weaver may expend a soul to bolster an undead creature, granting it a +1 profane bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and turn resistance, which increases by 1 for every 5 levels the soul weaver possesses. The creature also gains 1 temporary hit point per level. These bonuses last 1 hour.
Lovelorn Soul				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Lovelorn Soul								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:The soul weaver may expend a soul to aid an ally who is at negative hit points, but not dead. The ally becomes stable and gains temporary hit points equal to twice the soul weaver’s class level for 1 minute.
Siphon Health				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Siphon Health								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:The soul weaver may expend a soul to siphon health from a living creature. The target suffers 1d6 damage per 2 levels (minimum: 1d6, Fortitude half), and the soul weaver gains temporary hit points that last one hour equal to the damage dealt. A creature cannot be damaged beyond what would kill them.
Curious Spirit				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Curious Spirit								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:At 4th level, the soul weaver may expend one soul to commune with the spirit world, allowing her to speak with and question the ancestral dead. This allows her to make a single Knowledge check with an insight bonus equal to her Soul Weaver level + her Charisma modifier. This may be used to reroll a Knowledge check the soul weaver had previously failed, but no more than once per question. If the soul weaver is touching a body that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per level, she may summon and speak with that body’s spirit, which retains all knowledge it had in life but is under no obligation to answer any questions.
Summon Spirit I				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Summon Spirit I								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:At 4th level, the soul weaver may expend a soul to summon a poltergeist in the soul’s square or the summoned creature and remains for a number of rounds equal to the soul weaver’s Charisma modifier.
Channel Mastery				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Channel Mastery								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 8th level, a soul weaver may spend a soul in conjunction with channeling energy to add the benefits of any one feat which has channel energy as a prerequisite to that channeling. The soul weaver must meet all other prerequisites of that feat to gains its benefits in this manner.
Summon Spirit II				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Summon Spirit II								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 8th level, the soul weaver may expend a soul to summon either 1 shadow or 2 poltergeists in the soul’s square and/or the nearest unoccupied squares. Multiple creatures appear in adjacent squares to each other. A summoned creature cannot create spawn. These creatures last for a number of rounds equal to the soul weaver’s Charisma modifier.
Divine Soul					KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Divine Soul									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 8th level, the soul weaver may expend a soul in conjunction with channeling energy to increase the die size to d10s instead of d6s.
Blessed Soul				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Blessed Soul								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 8th level, the weaver soul may expend a soul as an immediate action to allow the target to reroll a saving throw it just failed.
Summon Spirit III				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Summon Spirit III								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 12th level, you may expend a soul to summon either 1 wraith, 2 shadows, or 4 poltergeists. This is similar in all other ways to Summon Spirit II.
Ghostpoint					KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Ghostpoint									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 12th level, the soul weaver may, when using a spell, spell-like ability, sphere ability, or soul weaver ability, target the effect as if she were standing in the same square as one of her souls. If the magic effect requires a touch attack, the soul may make the touch attack for the soul weaver, using her bonuses. This expends the soul.
Summon Spirits IV				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Summon Spirits IV								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 16th level, you may expend a soul to summon either 1 greater shadow, 2 wraiths, 4 shadows, or 4 poltergeists. This is similar in all other ways to Summon Spirit II.
Temporary Resurrection			KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Temporary Resurrection							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 16th level, the soul weaver may expend a soul to bring a creature who has died within 48 hours back to life. This lasts for 24 hours, and the target is returned to full health (although they do not recover other things, such as spells or spell points already used), and the target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this ability. This negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead. The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of effects that revive dead creatures. Once a creature has been revived with temporary resurrection, this ability cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.
Trap Soul					KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Trap Soul									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 16th level, if a target is at negative hit points or has died within 1 round, the soul weaver may expend a soul to trap the target’s soul. The target must succeed at a Will save or their soul is taken and added to the soul weaver’s bound nexus as a new soul, which they may expend and summon as normal (so long as the soul weaver possesses the trapped soul, the soul expended to use this ability is released from service and returns to the nether). This does not increase the soul weaver’s total number of souls. The subject of this ability cannot be resurrected unless the soul weaver is killed or voluntarily chooses to release the soul from service. While the soul is in the soul weaver’s possession, the soul weaver may speak with and question the soul, which retains the knowledge it had in life, but is under no obligation to answer questions (although bargaining for a peaceful release into the afterlife is usually enough to get a spirit to talk).
Summon Spirits V				KEY:Bound Nexus ~ Summon Spirits V								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 20th level, you may expend a soul to summon either 1 banshee, 1 dread wraith, 2 greater shadows, 4 wraiths, 4 shadows, or 4 poltergeists. This is similar in all other ways to Summon Spirit II.

#Block: The blight list of abilities is as follows:
Blight					KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Blight					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 2nd level, the soul weaver may touch a target and expend a use of Channel Energy to place a blight on them. The target is allowed a Fortitude save, and on a failure, grows a patch of festering undead flesh where he was touched (this patch may be hidden under the skin if the soul weaver chooses, so a target might not even know he’s been infected). Blight is considered a magical disease and is permanent until removed by magic or with the Heal skill. A blessing counters and dispels a blight, leaving neither blessing nor blight in place. A creature with blight suffers a -2 penalty to all saves against necromancy spells, Death sphere abilities, bound nexus powers, or blight abilities. A soul weaver may concentrate at any time to discover what creatures within Close range possess blight.
Lesion					KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Lesion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 6th level, a soul weaver may target a creature within Close range already suffering from a blight and expend a use of Channel Energy to cause that blight to rupture. This deals 1d6 damage per soul weaver level to the target (Fortitude half). Using lesion consumes and removes their blight.
Mind Blight					KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Mind Blight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:At 10th level, the soul weaver may use lesion to take control of a target instead of damage it. The blight spreads to their brain (Fortitude negates), giving them 4 points of ability drain to all mental ability scores and giving the soul weaver control over them for 1 hour per level or until the blight is cured. For the duration of this effect, the target can make only a standard action or move action on their turn, but not both. The target obeys all verbal commands (without a shared language, only basic commands such as come, fight, or stand still may be communicated) and does anything asked to the best of its ability, including self-destructive commands (a target command to hurt or kill itself deals its weapon damage + its Strength damage to itself per round until dead). Effects such as protection from evil or the hallow word from the Fate sphere do not end this effect, since it is the result of a physical malady rather than a mind-altering or possession effect. Unlike the standard lesion ability, mind blight does not consume the target’s blight when used, and the target may be subject to another lesion or mind blight, even while already under the effects of a mind blight. If another soul weaver attempts to use mind blight on a target already under the effects of mind blight, the two soul weavers make opposed checks (d20 + soul weaver level + their Charisma modifier) to determine who wins control of the target. Drain from multiple mind blights are cumulative.
Consume					KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Consume					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At 14th level, the soul weaver may use lesion to kill a target rather than damage it or take control of it. The target dies instantly (Fortitude negates) and raises the next round as a zombie under the soul weaver’s control for 1 hour per level. After the time is up, the body collapses and becomes simply another dead body. On a successful save, the target still suffers 1d6 damage per soul weaver level.
Detonate					KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Detonate				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At 18th level, when using your lesion ability to kill a target, you may also cause their blight to burst on a failed save, dealing 1d6 damage per soul weaver level to all adjacent targets (Reflex half).

#Block: The Blessing ability list includes the following:
Blessing					KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Blessing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At 2nd level, the soul weaver may touch a target and expend a use of Channel Energy to place a blessing on them (unwilling targets may make a Will save to resist). A blessing lasts for 24 hours and grants a +1 luck bonus to all saving throws.
Heal						KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Heal					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At 6th level, a soul weaver may target a creature within Close range already under the effects of a blessing and expend a use of Channel Energy to heal that target for 10 hit points per soul weaver level. Healing a target in this way consumes and removes their blessing.
Restore					KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Restore					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At 10th level, when you use your heal ability, the target is also cured of ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned.
Revive					KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Revive					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At 14th level, you may use your heal ability to bring targets back to life if they died while under the effects of a blessing, so long as the blessing has not yet expired. The target is restored with one permanent negative level.
Renew						KEY:Blessing/Blight ~ Renew					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soul Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At 18th level, when you use your heal ability, the target is also cured of all temporary and permanent negative levels (including the one gained if revived), as well as all ability drain.
