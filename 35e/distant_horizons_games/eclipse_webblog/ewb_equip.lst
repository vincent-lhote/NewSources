### Conjures
#	A Night Fan is a delicate fan which the user waves while he or she recites the charm written on it. It casts Blanket once per day, and so has a cost of [? (a Level Zero spell) x 1 (cast at Caster Level One) x 1800 GP (Unlimited-Use Command Word) x .2 (Usable Once per Day) x ? (Conjure)] = 90 GP, or 45 GP and 4 XP to make. You could halve that again by adding the Ambient Magic restriction - reducing the effective spell level to "-1" and the multiplier for it to .25 by greatly increasing the casting time - but why bother? If an adventurer wants this spell, he or she usually wants it to help avoid some thermal hazard, and usually wants it in a hurry.
#	A "Big Bag of Tools" casts "Implement" and "Power Tool" each three times per day, but it takes a minute or so to find any particular tool within the bag - a one-minute activation delay, which allows the application of the Ambient Magic limitation (reducing the two spells involved from a L0 and L1 spell combination to a L(-1) and L0 combination - both of which use the same calculation as the Night Fan with a x.6 instead of x.2). You never know when it will be convenient to get out your toolbag, rummage through it for a minute, and pull out a chainsaw, power drill, or jackhammer - even if such a tool will only last for ten minutes. A Big Bag of Tools has a total cost of 405 GP to buy, or 202.5 GP and 16 XP to make.
#	A Stores-Stone - a permanent Ward versus Vermin for a village granary or storage area - takes the form of a massive, rune-inscribed, stone pillar and costs [1 (Level Two Spell with the Ambient Magic Limitation to reduce it to Level One) x 1 (Caster Level One) x 2000 GP (Unlimited-Use Use-Activated) x .1 (Usable Once per Week) x? (Immobile) x ? (Conjure)] = 50 GP to buy, or 25 GP and 2 XP to make - a project well within the reach of almost any village mage and certain to prevent a good deal of spoilage and hunger in the long term. It's a bit less delicate than the standard Conjure, but a good whack from a log or something would still damage the runes.

#	Bracers of Legerdemain are sets of copper-and-enamel wristlets that produce a continuous Gauntlets effect - a boon to low-level Rogues. They will take several minutes to become effective after being put on, but that's a small price to pay for their protection. Unfortunately, they're as delicate as any other Conjure, which means that the user is well advised to take them off and store them somewhere safe before going into combat. They're also pretty simple: [.25 (a Level Zero spell reduced to Level (-1) by the Ambient Magic limitation) x 1 (cast at Caster Level One) x 2000 GP (Unlimited-Use Use-Activated) x ? (Conjure)] = 250 GP, or 125 GP and 10 XP to make.

#	A Wand of Transfusion is a delicate blown-glass tube which must be touched to the donor and then - trailing a globe of ruby light - to the recipient. That's [? (Level Zero Transfusion Spell) x 250 GP (50 Spell-Completion Charges) x ? (Conjure)] = 62.5 GP to buy or 32 GP and 3 XP to make.
#	An Air-Bladder contains a limitless supply of fresh air; all you have to do is stick the tube into your mouth and inhale. That's [? (Level Zero Create Element) x 1 (Caster Level One) x 2000 GP (Use-Activated Unlimited Use) x .75 (specialized application/air only) x ? (Conjure) = 375 GP to buy or 188 GP and 15 XP to create. Air-bladders are fragile, but will allow the user to operate underwater, in smoky areas, and in many gases, can supply plenty of breathable air if simply left to run, and can even be used to fill gasbags - and thus lift great weights - while underwater.

Painless Blade	TYPE:Magic.Conjure		SPROP:The wounds it inflicts may pass completely unnoticed, only works on three victims per day.	COST:300
#	A Painless Blade simply carries the Painkiller spell; the wounds it inflicts may pass completely unnoticed, possibly allowing a stealthy character to make several attacks before he or she is spotted. It can also, of course, be used to perform painless surgery, which is a boon to any doctor or veterinarian. Sadly - or perhaps fortunately - it will only work on three victims per day and the blade is quite thin and fragile; if used in direct combat a Painless Blade will probably wind up broken in short order. That's [? (a Level Zero Spell) x 1 (Caster Level One) x 2000 GP (Use-Activated Unlimited Use) x .6 (three uses per day only) x ? (Conjure) = 300 GP to buy or 150 GP and 12 XP to create.

Flarespear		TYPE:Magic.Conjure		SPROP:It's tip burns with a continuous flame, which does 1d4 points of damage. On command, it will spray a stream of highly-combustible oil through the flame, doing 2d4 points of nonmagical fire damage to everything within a 5' x 20' line and leaving them all on fire for 1d4 points the next round.	COST:1300
#A Flarespear is a hollow, ironbound, staff, with a constantly-refilled reservoir of light oil - naphtha. It's tip burns with a continuous flame, which does 1d4 points of damage. On command, it will spray a stream of highly-combustible oil through the flame, doing 2d4 points of nonmagical fire damage to everything within a 5' x 20' line and leaving them all on fire for 1d4 points the next round. Unfortunately, if someone hits the staff, it has only 5 Hardness and 5 Hits - and breaking it while it's lit tends to set the user, and his or her space, throughly on fire, while splashing neighboring spaces for 1d4 damage each. Similar problems often appear when the user is struck by magical fire and fails to save. A Flarespear is very useful against animals, vermin, swarms, and other minor threats, but has distinct limitations when used against more formidable - or smarter - opponents. It is, however, one of the most powerful Hedge Magic weapon enchantments available, and can certainly be quite dramatic.

#A Flarespear is built using three spell effects:

#      Hearthfire once per day [1 (Level Two Spell with the Ambient Magic Limitation to reduce it to Level One) x 1 (Caster Level One) x 1800 GP (Unlimited-Use Command Word) x .2 (Usable Once per Day) x ? (Conjure) x.8 (dangerous to use)] = 144 GP. This provides the flaming tip.
#      Fuel [1 (Level Two Spell with the Ambient Magic Limitation to reduce it to Level One) x 1 (Caster Level One) x 2000 GP (Unlimited-Use Use-Activated) x ? (Conjure) x.8 (dangerous to use)] = 800 GP. Sadly, the Ambient Magic limitation reduces the fuel production to a mere one gallon per round - but that's plenty to fuel a small flamethrower with.
#      Unplug Drains [? (a Level Zero) x 1 (cast at Caster Level One) x 1800 GP (Unlimited-Use Command-Word) x ? (Conjure) x .8 (dangerous to use)] = 360 GP. This is the effect that propels the fuel through the Hearthfire tip in a fine spray.
#That winds up with a net price of 1300 GP or 650 GP and 52 XP to make.

#   There are many other possible conjures - 
#Perfumer's Rods (Extract), Spyglasses (Magnify), Mirrors of Memory (Mnemonic), Surveyor's Transits (Tally Up), Rings of Animal Influence, Dowsing Rods, Girdles and Wands of Poison Resistance (Relieve Poison), and even "Cameras" (Snapshot) - but those should be enough to provide the basic idea.
